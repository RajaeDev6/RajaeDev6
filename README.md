## Hi there 👋
I'm Rajae, I Cybersecurity Student and a Software development enthusiast based in Jamaica
I build websites, mobile apps and command line tools, just whatever idea i have
I Usually get a new idea like once a day. haha
Whenever i am building my choice of tooling would be react, typescript for websites flask for backend stuffs, react native for mobile, golang, and c for command line
I haven't really made alot of my projects public as yet but i will soon

*Fun Fact*
